# Dual-Arm_Wheeled_Robot（目前正处于研发中，文件会陆续上传）

双臂轮式机器人Dual-Arm Wheeled Robot 它是一种集成了全向移动底盘和两条仿人机械臂的机器人系统。其核心设计理念是模仿人类的“身体”结构：用双腿移动，用双手操作。轮式底盘替代了双腿，提供了在平坦环境下的高效移动能力。 双臂轮式机器人是机器人技术集成化的巅峰体现之一。它不再是单一功能的工具，而是一个朝着通用型、自主化智能体方向发展的多面手。


一、 服务与接待领域 这是双臂轮式机器人最直观的应用领域，旨在直接与人交互，提供便利服务。


高端酒店与机场接待


迎宾与引导：通过人脸或语音识别客人，主动问候并引导至房间或登机口。


行李服务：自主跟随客人，用双臂稳妥地搬运行李箱（最多20-30公斤），并准确放入房间或行李推车。


物品递送：为客人递送毛巾、瓶装水、快递等到房间，实现“最后一米”的无人化服务。


餐厅与咖啡馆


餐盘回收：在自助餐厅，自主巡逻，识别并回收餐桌上的空盘和餐具，双臂协同保持平衡，避免残渣洒落。


后厨助手：进行简单的食材分装、餐具摆放等重复性工作，减轻人力负担。


点餐送餐：（未来）能够理解复杂指令，从厨房端取特定菜品，并安全地绕过动态障碍（如顾客和椅子），准确送达指定餐桌。


零售与仓储式商店


货架巡检与理货：夜间自动巡逻，利用视觉识别检测货架缺货、商品错放等情况，并用双臂进行整理和补货。


高位货架存取：替代人字梯，为顾客或店员拿取位于高处或低处的重物，如箱装水、大米等。


二、 医疗与康护领域 在此领域，机器人对精度、安全和可靠性要求极高。


医院内部物流


“药-床”精准配送：在药房与病房间自动运输药品、化验样本、无菌器械包。双臂设计确保在移动过程中物品平稳，并通过权限验证（如扫码）才能交接，实现全程可追溯。


医疗废料处理：定时收集各病房的医疗废料，进行密封和转运，减少医护人员接触感染源的风险。


康复辅助与老年护理


生活辅助：帮助行动不便的老人或患者完成日常活动，如端水喂药、开关灯/门、取遥控器、整理床铺等。


物理康复训练：作为智能康复设备，通过柔顺的双臂引导患者进行上肢运动训练，并实时记录运动数据供医生分析。


情感陪护与监控：具备简单的交互功能，提醒服药、监测跌倒异常，并通过陪伴聊天缓解孤独感。


三、 工业与实验室场景 在结构化或半结构化环境中，执行精确、重复或危险的任务。


轻型装配与检测


电子产品装配：在柔性生产线上，协同完成小型零部件的拿取、对准、按压和组装。


质量检测：一只手臂拿起产品，另一只手臂操纵传感器（如视觉相机、探针）对产品进行多角度、全方位的自动化检测。


实验室自动化


实验操作员：替代科研人员执行重复性、高通量的实验操作，如液体分装、试管搬运、摇床启停、仪器操作（如按按钮、旋钮）等，保证实验过程的标准化和可重复性。

仓储物流与分拣


“货到人”拣选：在小型仓库或电商分拣中心，机器人移动到货架前，识别并抓取形状各异的“非标”件商品（如玩具、日用品），这是传统机械臂难以处理的。


包裹处理：协同双臂搬运和放置中小型包裹，进行码垛或装车。


四、 特殊与极限作业 在这些场景中，机器人主要价值是替代人类进入危险环境。


核电站与辐射环境

电力巡检与维护


在变电站或配电室自主巡逻，使用双臂操作仪器（如红外测温仪）对设备进行检测，甚至能在远程操控下完成简单的维修任务，如清除障碍物、拧紧螺丝。


太空与深海作业


空间站机器人：如未来的空间站舱内助手，协助宇航员完成日常维护、实验操作，在微重力环境下稳定自身并操作物体。


深海勘探：在海底操作工具，采集地质和生物样本。

The dual-arm wheeled robot is a robot system that integrates an omnidirectional mobile base and two humanoid mechanical arms. Its core design concept is to imitate the "body" structure of humans: moving with legs and operating with hands. The wheeled base replaces the legs, providing efficient mobility in flat environments. The dual-arm wheeled robot is one of the peak manifestations of the integration of robot technology. It is no longer a single-function tool but a versatile multi-talented machine evolving towards a general-purpose, autonomous intelligent entity. 

I. Service and Reception Field
This is the most intuitive application field for dual-arm wheeled robots, aiming to directly interact with people and provide convenient services. 

High-end hotels and airport receptions 

Greeting and guiding: Identify guests through facial or voice recognition, greet them proactively and guide them to their rooms or boarding gates. 

Luggage service: The luggage follows the guest independently and is carried safely with both arms (up to 20-30 kilograms), and is accurately placed in the room or luggage cart. 

Item delivery: Delivering towels, bottled water, express deliveries, etc. to guests' rooms, achieving unmanned service for the "last mile". 

Restaurants and Cafes 

Dishware collection: In the cafeteria, patrol independently, identify and collect empty plates and utensils on the tables, and maintain balance with both arms to prevent food residue from spilling. 

Kitchen assistant: Perform simple tasks such as portioning ingredients and setting out tableware to reduce the workload on the staff. 

Order taking and food delivery: (In the future) It will be capable of understanding complex instructions, fetching specific dishes from the kitchen, and safely navigating around dynamic obstacles such as customers and chairs to accurately deliver the food to the designated table. 

Retail and Warehouse Stores 

Shelf inspection and inventory management: Automated night patrols use visual recognition to detect out-of-stock items and misplaced goods on shelves, and the dual arms are used for organizing and restocking. 

High shelf access: Replacing stepladders, it helps customers or store staff retrieve heavy items placed at high or low positions, such as cases of water or bags of rice. 

II. Medical and Healthcare Field In this field, robots are subject to extremely high requirements for precision, safety and reliability. 

Internal logistics in hospitals 

"Medicine-Bed" Precise Delivery: Automatically transport medicines, laboratory samples, and sterile instrument packages between the pharmacy and patient rooms. The dual-arm design ensures smooth movement of items during transportation, and handover can only be made after permission verification (such as scanning a code), ensuring full traceability throughout the process. 

Medical waste disposal: Collect medical waste from each ward on a regular basis, seal it and transfer it to reduce the risk of infection for medical staff. 

Rehabilitation Assistance and Elderly Care 

Life assistance: Helping elderly or patients with mobility issues complete daily activities, such as fetching water and administering medicine, turning lights and doors on and off, retrieving remote controls, and making beds. 

Physical rehabilitation training: As an intelligent rehabilitation device, it guides patients to perform upper limb movement training through its flexible arms and records the movement data in real time for doctors to analyze. 

Emotional companionship and monitoring: Equipped with simple interactive functions, it reminds users to take medicine, monitors abnormal falls, and alleviates loneliness through companionship chats. 

III. Industrial and Laboratory Settings: Performing precise, repetitive, or dangerous tasks in structured or semi-structured environments. 

Lightweight assembly and inspection 

Electronic product assembly: On a flexible production line, collaboratively complete the picking up, alignment, pressing and assembly of small components. 

Quality inspection: One arm picks up the product while the other arm operates the sensor (such as a visual camera or probe) to conduct multi-angle and all-round automated inspection of the product. 

Laboratory automation 

Experimental operators: They perform repetitive and high-throughput experimental operations on behalf of scientific researchers, such as liquid dispensing, test tube handling, starting and stopping shakers, and operating instruments (such as pressing buttons and turning knobs), ensuring the standardization and reproducibility of the experimental process. 

7x24-hour non-stop experiments: It can be programmed to achieve long-term, multi-step complex experimental processes, significantly enhancing research efficiency. 

Warehousing, logistics and sorting 

"Goods-to-person" picking: In small warehouses or e-commerce sorting centers, robots move to the shelves, identify and pick up variously shaped "non-standard" items (such as toys and daily necessities), which are difficult for traditional mechanical arms to handle. 

Package handling: Collaborative dual-arm lifting and placing of small and medium-sized packages for palletizing or loading onto vehicles. 

IV. Special and Extreme Operations In these scenarios, the main value of robots lies in their ability to replace humans in entering dangerous environments. 

Nuclear Power Plants and the Radiation Environment 

Carrying out inspections, operating valves, replacing simple components, and sampling and encapsulating contaminants within nuclear facilities can significantly reduce the radiation dose received by personnel. 

Power inspection and maintenance 

It can patrol independently in substations or distribution rooms, use its two arms to operate instruments (such as infrared thermometers) to inspect equipment, and even complete simple maintenance tasks under remote control, such as removing obstacles and tightening screws. 

Space and deep-sea operations 

Space station robots: Such as future cabin assistants on space stations, they assist astronauts in completing daily maintenance and experimental operations, and stabilize themselves and manipulate objects in a microgravity environment. 

Deep-sea exploration: Operating tools on the ocean floor to collect geological and biological samples.
